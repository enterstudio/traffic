traffic
=======

A simple traffic jam simulator.


Introduction
------------
One day I wondered why traffic jams occur as they are.
This project tries to reproduce the phenomenon and visualize it.
Originally it's written for OpenGL/GLUT, but there's a HTML5 canvas port.

Try it now on your browser!

Build
-----
The HTML5 version of this project needs no building.
You just need a modern browser to run it.
