traffic
=======

A simple traffic jam simulator.


Introduction
------------
One day I wondered why traffic jams occur as they are.
This project tries to reproduce the phenomenon and visualize it
with OpenGL/GLUT.


Build
-----
You need Visual Studio (Express) 2008 or later on Windows to
compile the project.
Also you need GLUT binaries (GLUT.dll and GLUT.lib).
Only the header file is included in this git repository.

It should be easy to port the project to GLUT-compatible
platforms.
